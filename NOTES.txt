IDEAS

Priority from high to low

- add pan to channel mixer
- verify that everything is sent on connect ! (again :) )
- extend show meta info with artist name, file version, creation & modification date, description
- refactor: move master controller send functions to fp4hw OK
- currently master settings restore preferences are not honored (some are loaded at startup, others not,
  independantly of preferences)
- load/save configs from menu
  + menu entries and dialogs 80%
  + obsolete remove configmanager OK
  + configs in performance window must be handled.. 50%
  + configs should write a summary to a cache file in the config dir, which should be
    used to provide descriptions in the timeline view. (other option is to use load
    descriptions in a background thread, and cache descriptions in .fp4config files)
- option to reset master controls on exit + button to reinitialise master settings
- add harmonizer
  + use a controller to turn on / off
  + use visual keyboard to draw chord
  + use choose 7 note scale or chromatic ?
- arpeggiator (but this requires timing...)
  + same remarks as harmonizer
- controller keys should be moved from channel generators to own window, and apply before
  notes are processed (by splits, other controller generators, and sends) so original note on
  can be suppressed
- refactor: move binding save/restore code from fp4hw to bindingmanager TEST
- bug: controller values are generated after note on, this may cause a click TEST
- bug: channel pressure: decay value goes too far (need more slow decays) TEST
- bug: keytime and controllerkeys channel are 0 based TEST
- bug: keytime and controllerkeys: controller goes from 0 to 128 TEST
- bug: instrument selecter in channels doens't preview instruments (doesn't send program changes)
- default channel configuration should have effect on for first channel
- preferences:
  + rename globalconnectionsettings to preferences
  + remove restore bindings OK
  + remove restore mappings OK
  + add bank mode OK
- rearrange interface to have reverb and chorus in tabs on main page, next to effects.
- save application version + metadata in config files
  + app name
  + app version
  + file type (splits, effects, bindings, configuration, timeline)
- bindings:
  + bug: binding manager is broken OK
  + bug: binding moves in table when edited OK
  + doubleclick for edit OK
  + add easing curves
  + keyboard bindings
  + link midibutton to binding editor OK
  + indicate that control is bound
  + add bindings from preset (in addition of replacing) OK
  + weird bugs when binding over existing bindings ?
- handle 2 fx parameters in channel configuration / channel controllers TEST ME
- tunings
- implement modulation configuration (lfo1&2 rate, pitch, tva & tvf depth)
- performances
  + scroll timelineview to focus active frame when next/previous buttons are pressed
  + show_mode keyboard bindings 50% (not for nextsong, nextinsong)
  + show_mode midi bindings OK
  + add song button must be disabled when string is empty
  + doubleclick preset should insert after current showpreset in timeline, or
    before if current preset is empty
  + warn when preset is removed when used in current (any?) show

checks:
- check if all channel's effect depth are restored if another effect is chosen
- check if master reverb is handled correctly (ie. preset/individual mode works)
- add modified indicator to preset name if effect parameters are changed
- controllers reset should set vibrato depth to 0: no ! center value is 0 vib !
  add tooltip to explain

bugs:
- bug: gs send data widget is behind other stuff
- bug: don't reset fx parameters when effect is saved
- bug: on GSreset / reinit / reconnect, m_fp4 notes table should be cleared
  if another keyboard is connected and uses the same channels, this will bug !
- bug: forbid (escape?) slashes in configuration names (and all saveable stuff)
- bug: channel instrument not sent when channel is activated ?
- bug: restore local on on exit ?
- bug: channel mappings: some padding is required because handles are clipped on left side for rangesliders

enhancements:
- FP4Win::m_fp4 should probably be moved to FP4ManagerApplication class
- use balance button as controller, convert fp4 message to continuous balance
- set defaults in master control thingy
- on program start, check if 'current' effect settings match a named preset, display that name instead
  of 'current'
- master presets for reverb and chorus
- toggle style controllers: one push on, next push off
- make balance knob available as virtual controller using its whole range. should be
  an option
- multiple input ports, with routing based on port/channel instead of just channel
  no usecases with my current hardware, 16 channels are enough
- multiple output ports. route to port/channel instead of just channel
  this would make it possible to use external/software synths. Ideally this would
  include autoconnect to output and autoload of synth software
- 1cc for several widgets ?
- effect parameter defaults: 80% (fine-tune effects like rotary)
- discover reverb and chorus parameters
- change effect value based on time since last key
- change effect value based on velocity of last key
- move all reverb/chorus etc settings from master+controllers to new window ?
- tap function to set tempo ? if possible... else tap function to set rates. needs thought.
- make instrument display mode switch look better
- tunings
- pretty icon
- icon for connected / disconnected
- more statusbar messages / menu->statusbar
- better about dialog

tests:
- check if feedback (49-89 -> 0-80%) can be set out limits !

problems
- add labels with buddies to widgets to make selection quicker
  >won't fix easily, we need accelerators in the labels to be able to do that.
- display current effect parameter value
  > how ? also the problem is that some scales seems to be log
  > or arbitrary so knowing the exact value won't say much.
  > ticks added instead to help visualize proportions: 100%
- display current effect help message when selected
  > where ? there's not much space left. hover on label is not too bad after all

should be documented gotchas
- pedal sends cc 64 values to channel 1 and 3. channel 3 is ignored else pedal becomes
  sustain + something else control at the same time.
