== Plan

- set instrument bank display mode in preferences, don't save last window state

- make global preferences accessible through qapp

- don't:
  + save geometries on window close

- on startup, from fp4win
  + restore favourites
  + restore effect list
  + restore autoconnect data
  + restore preferences
  + restore window geometries

  + restore current effect and settings
  + restore current instrument
  + restore master settings
  + restore channels
  + restore splits
  + restore bindings

- at app exit, in default file if confirmed by user:
  + save current effect name and settings
  + save current instrument
  + save all window geometries
    = performance window needs to have its splitter saved
  + save master settings
  + save channel settings
  + save splits
  + save bindings

- at app exit, in default file, w/out confirmation:
  + save instrument favourites

- effects:
  + save effect current to effect file when effect changes
  + save in compact mode (parameter array)

- on window close
  + save preferences in default file
  + save autoconnect settings in default file
  + save current performance in default timeline file

- configurations
  + put configurations in own directory, 1 configuration per file
  + create index file with summary for configurations

- timelines
  + one file each in own directory
  + save window geometries

== Current settings

FP4Win: geometry + bank display mode

FP4FX: current effect name

FXPresets: all presets for all fx

FavouriteInstruments: favourite instrument list

FP4MasterWin: geometry for master controllers

ConnectionSettings: preferences

MasterSettings: master controllers values

AutoConnectWin: geometry for autoconnect window

FP4ControllerWin: geometry for controllers window (obsolete, should be by channel ?)

ChannelInstrumentWin: geometry for channel instrument window (obsolete too)

ChannelInstruments: all channel related settings (instrument, controllers, monophonic, fx enabled) (only for "current" ?)

BindingsWin: geometry for controller bindings window

ControllerBindings: controller binding presets

configurationswin: geometry for configurations window

Master: same thing as [mastersettings] (master controller values) ??

Configurations: presets of entire configurations (ChannelInstruments+Effect+Bindings+Master+Splits)

showWin: performance window geometry

shows: presets of songs+configuration names

SplitsWindow: geometry of splits

ChannelControllersWin: geometry of channel controller windows

AutoconnectExternal: autoconnection alsa devices

ChannelMappings: splits
