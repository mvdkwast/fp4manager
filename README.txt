FP4 Manager.

This is an application for your Roland FP-4 and FP-7 digital piano. It allows
you to use effects that are not accessible directly. It also includes some
extra extra features that allow you to use the pan button, pedals and external
MIDI controllers to control those effects.

This is unfinished version, and would probably best be described as pre-alpha,
so I wouldn't recommend using it in a live setting. Especially the timeline
feature is buggy at best. As I won't have the time to improve this in a
foreseeable future I'm making this public in the hope that it can be useful to
someone.

FP4 Manager has only been tested on Linux with qt 4.7+ and uses the ALSA
Sequencer interface for MIDI communication. It has only been built with 4.7 and
uses some C++11 constructs.
